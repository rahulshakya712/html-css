10) The C++ language is ______ object-oriented language.

Pure Object oriented
Not Object oriented
Semi Object-oriented or Partial Object-oriented
None of the above
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: C

Explanation:

The common thing about the Pure Object-oriented language it provides three basic features like Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism. Each programming language that supports these entire three features is known as the Pure-Object oriented language. Whereas if a programming language support all these three features but not support completely are known as the Partial-Object oriented languages or the Semi Object-oriented languages

The main reasons why the C++ programming language is Known as Semi-Object oriented language are as follows:

Availability of the Friend function-
A friend class is allowed to access private and protected members of another class, within which it is declared a friend. It may be very useful for some time, but still, it violates the rule of the Object-Oriented features.
Concept of the Global variable-
As we all know that we can declare a global variable in C++ language that can be easily accessible from anywhere within the program. So again, C++ does not provide complete privacy because no one is restricted to access and manipulate that data/information. Hence it offers partial Encapsulation, unlike Java Language, in which a user only allows to declare a variable within the class and can provide access specifier to it.
The main function is Out-side the class-
C++ is an object-oriented language, but still, object-oriented is not fundamentally related (or implicit) to the language. So a user can easily write a valid, well-defined C++ code even without using any object once.
11) Which of the following features is required to be supported by the programming language to become a pure object-oriented programming language?

Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
All of the above

Set of MCQ Based on Arrays of the C++
1) Which of the following refers to characteristics of an array?

An array is a set of similar data items
An array is a set of distinct data items
An array can hold different types of datatypes
None of the above
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: A

Explanation: Basically, an array is a set of similar data items that are stored in the contiguous memory blocks. You can access any data item randomly using the index address of the element s.

2) If we stored five elements or data items in an array, what will be the index address or the index number of the array's last data item?

3
5
4
88
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: C

Explanation: The array uses the contiguous block of memory for storing the data elements. Hence the data items pushed into an array are stored at the continuous address space. The index number of the array begins with zero so, the first data item pushed into the array will be stored at zero and so on. Hence index number of the last (fifth) element will be 4.

3) Which of the following is the correct syntax for declaring the array?

init array []
int array [5];
Array[5];
None of the above
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: B

Explanation: To declare an array in C++, we first need to specify its data type according to requirements such as int or char, afterward that the array's name and the size of the array. So the correct answer will be B.

Example: Array declaration by specifying size and initializing elements

int arr[8] = { 10, 20, 30, 40 };
The compiler will create an array of size 8, initializes the first four elements as specified by the user and rest elements as 0

The above is just same as

"int arr[] = {11, 22, 32, 44, 0, 0,0,0}".
4) Which of the following is the correct syntax for printing the address of the first element?

array[0];
array[1];
array[2];
None of the above
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: A

Explanation: To print or access the first data item of the array, the correct syntax is "array[0];" because the array's index begins with zero instead of one. So the correct answer will be A.

5) Which of the following gives the 4th element of the array?

Array[0];
Array[0];
Array[3];
None of the above
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: C

Explanation: The index of the array begins with zero instead of 1. To print the 4th element of the array, the index number will be n-1 or (3);

using namespace std;  
int main()  
{  
int array[] = {10, 20, 30};  
cout << -2[array];  
return 0;  
}

Answer: B

Explanation: It will print the negative value of the specified values because the "-" sign we used while specifying the array elements. So the correct answer will be the "-30".

7) Which type of memory is used by an Array in C++ programming language?

Contiguous
None-contiguous
Both A and B
Not mentioned
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: A

Explanation: In the C and C++ programming language, the memory used by an array is usually contiguous, which means when an array is declared or initialized in the program a block of memory is selected form the memory space immediately. The major drawback of an array is that users have to guess the size of the array before actually using it, in which a significant amount of memory will be occupied even when it is not used. This later creates the problem of lack of memory.

8) Which of the following is the correct definition of sorting?

Sorting is a type of process in which the data or information is ordered into a specific order. Example increasing orders, decreasing.
Sorting information or data only in increasing order
Sorting is a type of process in which data elements are modified or manipulated
None of the above
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: A

Explanation: Sorting is a type of technique or process in which the locations of data elements hold by the array are reordered or manipulated. So the correct answer will be A.

For Example

    return 0;  
}  
110
001
010
None of the above
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: C

Explanation: The correct output will be "010" Because in both cases, A and C variables passed to the "is_array()" function are different, so the function returns zero in both cases while in the case of B, they are the same. Hence it returns one as the output.

13) Read the given C++ program carefully and choose the correct output from the given options:

MCQ Based on the Oops Concepts of the C++
1) Which of the following statement is true about the new and malloc?

I. The "new" is a type of operator while "malloc" is a kind of function
II. "new" invokes a constructor, whereas "malloc" does not invoke the constructor
III. "malloc" returns void pointer and also needed to typecast whereas "new" returns required the pointer

Only I
Both I and II
I, II, III
None of the above
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: C

Explanation: All statements mentioned in the above question are completely true about the "malloc" and the "new." The "malloc" is a kind of function available in the C++ language, while the "new" is a type of operator that invokes the Constructor.

2) Which of the following statement is true about the new and malloc?

I. The pointer object initialization of a specific class using "malloc" also needs to include constructor calls; on the other hand, doing so with the "new" keyword does not include any constructor calls.
II. The pointer object initialization of a specific class using the "new" keyword also needs to include a constructor call. On the other hand, doing so with the "malloc" does not need to include any constructor calls.
III. Pointer object initialization of a specific class using either "new" or "malloc" involves the constructor call.

Only II
Both II and III
Only I
None of the above
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: A

Explanation: In object initialization of a class using the "new" keyword also involves a constructor call, while doing so with the "malloc" does not require any involvement of the constructor call. This is the main reason why the "new" is added explicitly in the C++ language. However, the "malloc" function is used to assign the memory to any specific pointer, so it assigns an equal amount of memory to the class size. At the same time, the "new" keyword involves the initialization, hence invokes the Constructor of that particular class.

3) Which of the following statement is correct about Virtual Inheritance?

It is a technique to ensure that a private member of a base class can be accessed
It is a technique to optimize the multiple inheritances

}  
Segmentation failure.
Error.
The Constructor will be invoked five times, and after that destructor will be invoked only once.
The Constructor will be invoked five times, and after that destructor will also be invoked five times.
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: D

Explanation: As mentioned in the above-given program, five-pointer variables are initiated using the "new" keyword so that the Constructor will be invoked five times. In addition, the destructor "Delete[]" is used( that is used for deleting the group of the several objects) for terminating variables. Hence all of the variables will be terminated completely, and while terminating the variables, the destructor will be invoked five times.

6) Consider the following given program and choose the most appropriate output from the given options:

#include<iostream>   
using namespace std;

None of the above
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: B

Explanation: In the above-given program, the derived class's object is storing in the base class pointer; while the object is destroyed, the program has never invoked the destructor of the Derived class. Therefore, it shows that the object is not destroyed at all; hence, in this case, the program may also behave undesirably.

12) Which of the following statement is not true about C++?

Members of a class are public by default
A class cannot have the private members
A structure can have the member functions
All of the above
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: C

Explanation: In C, structures are not allowed to have member functions; while on the other hand, C++ allows the structure to have the member functions. Members of the class are generally private by default, and those of the structures are public. So it is a completely false statement that classes can not private members.

Answer: A

Explanation: One can easily implement the Compile-time Polymorphism using the Template.

23) How can one implement the run-time Polymorphism in the C++ programming language?

By using the Template
By using the concepts of inheritance
By using both the virtual functions and inheritance
By using only the virtual functions
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: In C++, one can implement the run-time Polymorphism by using the virtual functions and inheritance where the object decides which function to call.

Explanation: C

24) Which of the following offers a programmer the facility of using a specific class object into other classes?

Polymorphism
Abstraction
Inheritance
Composition
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: D

Explanation: The composition is referred to as the concept of using objects of a specific class into several other classes.

25) Which one of the following cannot be a friend in C++ languages?

A Class
A Function
An Object
None of the above
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: C

Explanation: In general, an object of any class cannot be a friend of the same and any other class as well. However, there are some functions, operator, and classes which can be made a friend.

26) How are the references different from the pointer?

A reference cannot be modified once it initialized
There is no need of an extra operator for dereferencing of a reference
A reference cannot be NULL
All of the above
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: D

Explanation: These are some basic reasons why the references are far different from the pointers.

In the case of pointers "*" operator is required for dereferencing the value contain by it. However, the reference does not need any type of operator for deference.

A Reference cannot be modified once it is initialized, but it is possible to do so in the case of a pointer.

A pointer can be made Null, whereas a reference cannot be NULL.

27) Among the following given options, which can be considered as a member of a class?

Class variable
Member variable
Class functions
Both A and B
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: B

Explanation: Generally, the functions of any class are also considered as the member function of that class.

28) Which of the following refers to the wrapping of data and its functionality into a single individual entity?

Modularity
Abstraction
Encapsulation
None of the above
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: C

Explanation: In C++, the property of wrapping the data and its functionality into a single entity is known as Encapsulation ( e.g., Classes).

29) Which of the following refers to using the existing code instead of rewriting it?

Inheritance
Encapsulation
Abstraction
Both A and B
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: A

Explanation: With the help of the inheritance concept, one can use existing code instead of rewriting. We can do this by inheriting the properties of pre-written code in other parts of the code blocks. Therefore the user is not required to write the same code repeatedly.

30) Among the following, which shows the Multiple inheritances?

X,Y->Z
X->Y->Z
X->Y;X->Z
None of the above
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: A

Explanation: In multiple inheritances, a single class can inherit properties form more than one base class.

31) Which of the following statements is true about the C++ programming language?

C++ is an object-oriented programming language
C++ is a procedural programming language
C++ is a functional programming language
C++ is both procedural and object-oriented language
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: D

Explanation: C++ is a type of programming language which supports both the procedural ( or step by step instructions) and object-oriented through the concept of classes.

32) Among the following, which statement is correct about the Modularity?

Modularity means hiding the parts of the program
Modularity refers to dividing a program into subsequent small modules or independent parts
It refers to overloading the program's part
Modularity refers to wrapping the data and its functionality into a single entity
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: B

Explanation: Modularity refers to dividing a program into small independent code blocks or modules so that they can be easily called anywhere in the entire program where it is required. The concept of Modularity is very efficient and helpful for developers because it makes the program well structured and easy to understand. Hence the correct option is D.

33) Read the following program carefully and find out which concept from the given options is not used or missing in the following program?

Program

class A  
{  
    int x;  
    public:  
    void print(){cout<<"hello"<<x;}  
}  
   
class B: public A  
{  
    int y;  
    public:  
    void assign(int a){y = a;}  
}  
Polymorphism
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Abstraction
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: A

Explanation: As we can see in the above-given program, the variables X and Y both are private members, which means they both are hidden from the outside world of the class, so here the concept of abstraction is used.

The other data members and their corresponding functions are stored in an individual class, so here the concept of Encapsulation is also used. In addition, Class B is derived from Class A, which means the concept of inheritance is used as well, but still, we didn't find and an overloaded function in any of the classes. Therefore the concept of Polymorphism is missing or not used in the given program.

34) Which of the following options correctly explains the concept of Polymorphism?

a.

int func(float);  
float func(int, int, char);  
b.

int func(int);  
int func(int);  
c.

int func(int, int);  
float func1(float, float);  
d. None of the above
